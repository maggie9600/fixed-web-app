SQL injection:
This vulnerability is easy to fix as it was present in input field for email, so validating
proper email will fix this vulnerability.

Reflected XSS:
This is also similar to SQL injection vulnerability's fix. As sanitising the inputs will
eventually fix this vulnerability along with other vulnerabilites.

Command injection:
Getting only numbers as a input to prevent user from injecting commands, also those inputs
are individually checked for any malicious injection.

Open URL redirection:
It is fixed by giving a default input and preventing the parameter to get input from user.
By this method we can prevent open URL redirection vulnerability.

Stored XSS:
It was due to getting all HTML special characters as it is, so now those special characters
are encoded and stored so as to prevent stored XSS.

IDOR:
IDOR generally is a high risk vulnerability, when it is present in password reset page
it is super risky and needs to be fixed as quick as possible. This was fixed by adding
additional parameter for validating along with a new table to store the validation key
so as to prevent tampering of users table.

PHP injection:
This was due to validations, and that was not needed to the web app. so removal of it 
made the job easy and fixed the vulnerability of PHP injection.

Security misconfiguration(Leaving configuration page enabled):
This was fixed by removing the configuration page.
